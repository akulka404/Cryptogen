## Using the Cryptogen.UI to easily encrypt and decrypt images using the <h1> Cryptogen Library </h1>

clone the repo using 
<code> git clone </code>
1. Change the path to Cryptogen_UI folder
2. I have included the requirements.txt file in the folder.
3. Install the required packages using <code> pip3 install -r /path/to/requirements.txt </code>
4. The .whl file for cryptogen is also uploaded in the same directory so you can use: pip3 install name_of_the_file.whl
