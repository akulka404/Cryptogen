## Using the Cryptogen.UI to easily encrypt and decrypt images using the <h1> Cryptogen Library </h1>

clone the repo using 
<code> git clone https://github.com/battcheeks/Cryptogen.git </code>
1. Change the path to Cryptogen_UI folder
2. I have included the requirements.txt file in the folder.
3. Install the required packages using <code> pip3 install -r /path/to/requirements.txt </code>
4. The .whl file for cryptogen is also uploaded in the same directory so you can use: <code> pip3 install cryptogen-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl </code>
